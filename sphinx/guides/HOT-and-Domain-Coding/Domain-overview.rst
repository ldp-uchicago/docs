Domain Coding
=============

Domain coding was completed in 2015 on all early home visits according to the following schedule:  
Every utterance was coded for domain at three timepoints -- 02H, 07H, and 12H.  For the remaining home visit transcripts,
only the utterances coded as containing HOTs (Higher Order Thinking in speech) were also coded for domain.  

Plans for the middle school visits include adding domain coding to the HOTs utterances.

General Guidelines
==================

There are 13 categories for domain coding (see below) and an *unspecified* category. Every utterance coded for domain will be categorized
in at least one of the 14 domains.

1. Code the domain of every line by placing a "1" in the correct domain column.

   * If an utterance is completely indistinguishable (### with no intelligible speech surrounding it) it should be coded as unspecified. If there is enough context from intelligible speech either within the utterance or in surrounding lines, make your best guess as to the domain.
  
   * Utterances like "yes," "yeah," "no," "ok," "mmhm," "what?" and "huh?" that are in response to something previously said should be coded in the same domain as the previous utterance. (e.g. Child: "Frogs are amphibians." PCG: "Yeah, uhhuh." Both utterances should be coded as Natural World.)

2.  Some utterances will fall into multiple domains. Code primary, secondary, and tertiary (if present) with 1,2, and 3 respectively. 
Remember all utterances will have a primary domain (1) but secondary domains are coded only as needed.

Overview of Domains
===================

**Social:** how we interact with others, societal constructs

**Emotional:**  feelings

**Natural World:**  changes in state, how things work, nature, science; short name="NW"

**Mathematics:**  geometry, shapes, numbers, counting, calculations, measurements; short name="Math"

**Spatial Reasoning:**  spatial arrangements; short name="SR"

**Literacy and Print:**  book talk, writing, spelling, word play, word meanings; short name="LaP"

**Art, Music, and Design:**  visual and performing arts, music, artists, art history, design; short name="AMD"

**Sports:**  rules to physical contests, sports supplies and apparel

**Behavior Management:**  behavioral directives; short name="BM"

**Behaviors:**  narration of action, not directives

**Preference:**  favorites, likes, dislikes

**Recitiation/Script:** reading out loud, ritualized interactions; short name = "R/S"

**Rules:**  stating rules to a game, not directives within a game

**Unspecified:**  any utterance that does not fall into any of the above domains, or is completely indistinguishable or without sufficient context
