HOT and Domain Coding Overview
*******************************
Higher order thinking (HOT) in speech was coded in all of the early transcripts (visits 01H to 12H) for both the typically-developing children (TD) and parents and the children with perinatal lesions (PL) and their parents. Domain coding was completed for every utterance that was coded as HOT, and for all utterances at three timepoints (02H, 07H, and 12H). The early visits were HOT- and Domain-coded in Excel sheets extracted from the LDP utterance database.  

In 2016, HOT and Domain coding was initiated on the 5th grade transcripts of parent-child interactions.  HOT coding on these transcripts is being done in Datavyu.  

HOT Coding and Utterances
The basic unit of transcription is the utterance.  HOT coding is done on the utterance level, i.e., if an utterance contains at least one of the four types of HOT, then the utterance is coded as HOT.  More than one type of HOT can be coded for each utterance, e.g., an utterance can be both a comparison and an inference.  While any single topic of conversation can include both utterances containing HOT and utterances without HOT, only code as HOT those utterances containing the instance of HOT in speech.

Four Types of HOT
#. Inference: Deriving a conclusion not otherwise given by using known (or logical) premises
#. Abstraction: A mental framework or model that is used to facilitate the process of cognition and perception, and successfully apply categories and organization to a concept - from the specific to the general.
#. Comparison: Uses an explicit framework of speech to point out a similarity or difference between two representations: source and analog
#. Hierarchy: An arrangement of categories (concepts), with a superordinate and subordinate framework; kinds of things - from the general to the specific

Every HOT in speech is either an "ask" or a "give"
Rule: 

Surface vs. Structure
Every HOT utterance is coded either as a structure HOT or a surface HOT.
