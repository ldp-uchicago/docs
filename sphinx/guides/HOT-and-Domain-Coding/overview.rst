HOT and Domain Coding Overview
*******************************
Higher order thinking (HOT) in speech was coded in all of the early transcripts (visits 01H to 12H) for both the typically-developing children (TD) and parents and the children with perinatal lesions (PL) and their parents. Domain coding was completed for every utterance that was coded as HOT, and for all utterances at three timepoints (02H, 07H, and 12H). The early visits were HOT- and Domain-coded in Excel sheets extracted from the LDP utterance database.  

In 2016, HOT and Domain coding was initiated on the 5th grade transcripts of parent-child interactions.  HOT coding on these transcripts is being done in Datavyu.  Domain coding will be done on HOT utterances in Datavyu.
