Surface vs. Structure
=====================

General Guidelines
==================

Every HOT utterance is coded either as a *structure HOT* or a *surface HOT*.  See specific pages for each type of HOT for further examples of surface vs. structure.  

*  If an utterance is both surface and structure, then structure trumps surface.

*  The depth of description provided will determine if an utterance is surface or structure.

   *``I wonder what we could put in there is *surface*``

   *``It's a round hole and two inches deep, I wonder what we could put in there is *structure*``

*  If you aren't sure what an utterance means, code as surface.

Surface Guidelines
===================

Code as surface when HOT speech:

*  Relates preferences, wants, desires, or needs.

*  Describes relationships with physical sensations such as:

    *Temperature
    
    *Hunger
    
    *Pain
    
    *e.g. When you kick me, that hurts.
    
*  Describes relationships with physical attributes such as:

    *Color
    
    *Appearance
    
    *Weight
    
    *Sound
    
    *Strength
    
    *e.g. Daddy is stronger than Mommy.
    
  
Structure Guidelines
======================

Code as structure when HOT speech:

#.  Makes a connection using theory of mind.
#.  Makes a leap or jump that isn't immediate or obvious.
#.  Brings in outside knowledge beyond what is contained in the actual text.
#.  Conjectures about someone else's wants.
#.  Describes potential properties (that are not immediate or obvious).
#.  Makes a connection using multiple, complex links.
#.  Makes a connection about objects or properties not physically seen, so they are not understood just by perception.
#.  Explains something about the nature of the world.

        ``You're a good kid because you are very kind.`` is structure
        
        ``She's a good kid like you.`` is surface
