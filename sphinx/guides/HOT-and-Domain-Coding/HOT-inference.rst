Inference
=========

**Inference:** Deriving a conclusion not otherwise given by using known or logical premises.

Instances of Inference
======================

Inference is the most common type of HOT speech that we code.  These types of speech should be coded as inference.

1.  Causality: Must explictly state the relationship between one event (the cause) and the second event (the effect), where the first event **necessitates** the second event.

    * includes most coherent utterances with *because* but **not** children's utterances lacking a clear syntax of cause and effect
      ``try this: get rid of *because* in the utterance. If utterance still has a causal meaning, code as HOT.``
    
    * so can represent a causual relationship
      ``do not code when *so* is used to introduce a topic, this is not causal``
    
    * includes most coherent instances of *how come, why,* and *what for*
    
    * includes some instances of *for* as explanation, when glossing to "for the purpose of"
    
         ``do not code when *for* is used to assign one thing to another, such as specific foods for a meal, a person for a social role, or a gift for a party``
         ``try this: turn the utterance into a short dialogue. Use what comes before the *for* as the first line, then pretend a second speaker asks "why?" if the rest of th eutterance makes a coherent and causal resopnse, this is likely HOT-inf.``
         
      * non-temporal *until* can (sometimes) be causal
      
      * non-directional and non-infinitive *to* can (sometimes) be causal
            ``try this: replace *to* with *in order to*. Does the utterance have the same causal meaning? If yes, then code as HOT.
            
 2.  *Conditionals:*  Speculation about what could or will happen with predictable cause.
   
      * if/then structure is very important and should be coded
      
            ``if the speaker drops *then,* the utterance can still be HOT-inf.``
            ``if the speaker drops the *if/then* structure entirely (e.g. replaces it with a conjunction like *and*, this is not HOT and should not be coded.``
            ``try this: flip the clauses in the utterance. Does the utterance still have a causal meaning? If yes, then the utterance is likely HOT. (e.g. "I'll use this if it's microwave safe" flips to "If it's microwave-safe, then I'll use this" and is still causal).``
            
      * speculation could include keywords like *think* or *doubt*
