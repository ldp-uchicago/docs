.. _HOThier:

Hierarchy
==========

*Hierarchy:* An arrangement of categories (concepts), with a superordinate and subordinate framework; kinds of things - from the general to the specific.

Instances of Hierarchy
=======================

Hierarchy is relatively uncommon in our coding. These types of speech should be coded as HOT-Hierarchy.

*Kinds of Things:*   Explicit language such as "kind of" or "type of" is used to describe sorts of things.
    The explicit language must be present. This means that speech that is descriptive rather than hierarchical should not be coded. Listing types or probing for types is considered descriptive unless explicit language exists to mark it as hierarchy.

Keep in Mind

*  *Multiple Utterances:* If a teaching technique is split across multiple utterance, it must have at least two elements in the hierarchies. Code the last line and replace all 1 s with asterisks (*) in the related rows.
*  *Kinda Sorta:* If you can replace "kind of" or "sort of" with "kinda" or "sorta", these terms are being used in a non-heirarchical structure and should not be coded. In recent transcriptions, you will often see these transcribed as kind+of instead of kind of, which should let you know immediately not to code it. In older transcripts, however, these might not be differentiated, and you will need to judge for yourself.

Keywords
=========

These words often (not always) indicate HOT-Comparison:

*  kind (of)
*  type (of)
*  sort (of)

Surface vs. Structure
======================

HOT-Hierarchy is usually structure, but can sometimes be surface.

Refer to the Surface vs. Structure general guidelines to make sure an instance of Hierarchy meets the requirements for Structure.
