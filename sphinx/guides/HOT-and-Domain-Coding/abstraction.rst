.. _abstraction:

Abstraction
===========

**Abstraction**: A mental framework or model that is used to facilitate the process of cognition and perception, and successfully apply categories and organization to a concept - from the specific to the general.

Instances of Abstraction
========================

Abstractions are not very common in our coding. These types of speech should be coded as HOT-Abstraction.

*Organizing Knowledge:* People use abstractions to organize current knowledge and provide a framework for future understanding. Types of this organization could include:

 *    rubric: academic learning
 *    social: socially defined habitual routines or social rules where events enable other events
 *    stereotypes: generalizations that may or may not be true of all of a type of something
 *    social roles: assigned traditional behavior or value to someone based on their occupation, status, gender, etc.
 *    scripts: speech that has become mostly rote for the user
 *    worldview: description of beliefs or values of an individual or group that are extended outward generally
 *    archetypes: description of "most typical" of a type of person or thing
 *    habits: descriptions of habitual behaviors, only HOT if generalized to a type of person instead of a particular person
 
*Definitions:* Beyond basic labels (places, objects, people, adjectives, etc.), attempts to describe or define a word or concept are generally abstractions.

*Codification:* Abstraction occurs when a quality or behavior is applied to a class of something as a way of identifying that class. This commonly seen with animal sounds and letters/spelling.

Keep in Mind
============

* *Abstractions of an Individual:* Abstraction can extend to description of an individual rather than a class, but only if there is explicit language dismissing exceptions, such as always or never.
* *Think Twice About Behavior Modification:* Abstraction is often used to modify behavior, but not all behavior speech is HOT-abstraction. To code this as HOT, there must be an overarching generalization beyond simple instruction. Try finding the two indexes. With behavior speech, the first will likely be a class of people (e.g. "nice boys", "polite people") or a desirable/undesirable quality (e.g. "It's smart to...", "It's not nice to...") and the second will the way that class or quality behaves (e.g. "...help their grandmas", "...read books", "...throw books at their grandmas").
* *"You" Generalizations:* Some abstractions are not made with general terms like "people" or "children", but using the generic "you" (or "we") rather than "you" directed at the listener. If you can replace all instances of "you" with "one" while preserving the intent of the utterance ("you look both ways before crossing the street" becomes "one looks both ways..."), the utterance might be an abstraction. To decide, consider the context of the utterance. If the utterance can apply to the immediate situation that the listener is in, then the utterance is not an abstraction. If the utterance is removed from the situation it describes and is triggered by something like a book, memory, or observation of another person, this should be coded as a surface abstraction.

Keywords
========

These words often (not always) indicate HOT-Abstraction:

 * always
 * all
 * never
 * none

Surface vs. Structure
======================

Most HOT-Abstraction will be structure, though some will be surface.

Code as surface when...
  *  modifying behavior **without** explanation
  *  talking about animal sounds
  *  the abstraction is also letter/sound/spelling talk
  *  the abstraction is an out-of-context "you"-generalization (see above)
 
Code as structure when...
  *  modifying behavior with explanation
  *  defining an unknown word/concept
  *  describing social constructs or organizing worldviews
