Domain Descriptions
===================

**Social**:
The following types of speech are in the Social domain:

* Perspective taking
* Interpersonal conflict/competition (including needs)
* Explicitly explaining that ones actions are motivated by feelings towards another
* Relates how we interact with others, society, or culture, not simply comparing two people (actions, looks, etc.)
* May concern facts about family members, kinship systems
* Assertion of identity, but must be more than a simple description of a trait
* Does not include assertion of ownership of objects
* Society-wide social abstractions/norms, such as gender talk or age talk
* Concepts like "nice," "mean," "kind," "good," "evil," etc.
* Ideas of "magic words" in society such as "please" or "thank you", noting that requests for "please" or "thank you" is recitation rather than social
* How we should interact with others in a more general sense than specific directives
* Identification of social roles, noting that this is the weakest possible Social instance
* Celebration of holidays or discussion of holiday traditions
* Social roles and future jobs, noting that if the role fits better into a different domain (e.g. discussing drummers is AMD, discussing what doctors do is NW) that domain should be coded over Social
* People from different countries and their traditions

**Emotional:**
The following types of speech are in the Emotional domain:

* Discussing feelings (emotion words)
* Expressing love
* Emotional adjectives are only emotional if describing personal feelings, and can exist in utterances that are not in this domain
* Physical states or conditions (e.g. tired, hungry, thirty, ok, etc.) are not emotions
* Descriptors like "funny" or "silly" are not emotions

**Natural World:**
The following types of speech are in the Natural World domain:

* Science, technology, engineering, physical sciences, natural sciences
* Changes in state such as aging, physical states, and changes in color
* Mechanics of how things work such as understanding simple and complex machines, differences between machines or objects, or how electricity works
* Functionality of objects including fixing things, noting that saying something is "broken" is not sufficient without additional information
* Nature including weather, water, animals, outer space, plants, food from the earth, and geography, noting that mentioning these topics is not sufficient without also saying something about them
* Natural waste, trash, pollution, noting that while cleaning things is not sufficient, discussion of how cleaning works is
* Explaining things about the body
* Health, including discussion of healthy food (but not food preferences)
* Cooking and food talk, including discussion of chemical reactions during cooking and identifying real and pretend food
* Artistic representations of natural phenomena, unless the point is to understand the artwork

**Mathematics:**
The following types of speech are in the Mathematics domain:

* Measurements: quantity, size, height, speed, depth, weight, degrees, movement
* Numbers: counting, calculations, how to write numbers, recognizing Arabic numerals
* Estimation
* Specific shapes and shape attributes
* Phrases using words like "big" may not be mathematics
* Having a "math word" in an utterance does not mean it is necessarily math

**Spatial Reasoning:**
The following types of speech are in the Spatial Reasoning domain:

* Spatial relations (using words like "above", "below", "next to", etc.)
* Manipulating objects in the context of other objects; turns, flips, and slides of objects to check for congruency
* Talk of "fitting"
* Where/location questions are not necessarily spatial, but are coded as spatial if answered with explicit localization/spatialization speech
* Movements upon other objects (note that movements on the self are behavioral)
* Use of "here" vs. "there" or "far" vs. "near" are not specific enough without being able to identify the object of reference (gestures can be used to help identify the reference)
* Use of "here" to get attention rather than locate something is not spatial (typically from parents)
* Metaphorical uses of spatial language are not spatial

**Literacy and Print:**  The following types of speech are in the Literacy and Print domain:

* Word pronunciation (when age appropriate, typically very young children)
* Spelling talk, how to write letters, how to recognize letters
* Discussion of reading as a topic (not enough to mention reading)
* Book talk (title, author, literary frame, meta-talk about stores, "once upon a time", etc.)
* Drawing references between books and real life
* Meanings and definitions (words, idioms, phrases, semantic distinctions, names of objects, etc.); labeling is not enough, must also define it
* Rhymes
* Jokes
* Bible references
* Book reading itself is not LaP; should be coded as Scripts/Recitation

**Art, Music, and Design:** The following types of speech are in the Art, Music, and Design (AMD) domain:

* Visual art (painting, scultpting, drawing, crafts, etc.)
* Questions (especially serial questions) can make an exchange into art
* Discussion of tools used to create art is AMD
* Performing art (music, dancing, theater, movies)
* Character identification (non-book), including video and board game characters, and holiday figures
* Talk about artists, actors, and musicians
* Singing a made-up song, including invented songs/repetition of words musically, talk about melody and rhythm (but NOT reciting an established song like Happy Birthday)
* Art history and museums
* Design, architechture, building things, creativity, inventing
* Color as a topic of conversation (must discuss something about color or colors rather than mentioning a color as a descriptor)
* Simply saying whether art is good or bad is not enough
* Labeling the subject of an artwork is not enough

**Sports:** The following types of speech are in the Sports domain:

* Sporting equipment
* Physical games and contests
* Activities in this domain should be based mostly on physical skill (e.g. strength, aim, balance, flexibility)
* Although competition should be an aspect of most activities in this domain, it is not absolutely necessary if the "sport" is based primarily on physical activity. Ex - yoga is a sport. However, adding the element of competition and regulation to some non-sport activities may categorize them as a sport. Ex - general hunting is not a sport but skeet shooting would be.
* When discussing athletes and other people in the realm of sports, it should only be categorized as "sport" if it references their purpose in the sport (like a referee) or their specific athletic ability. Just referencing the person's name or physical description is not enough. Ex - "You are dunking that basketball like Michael Jordan" is sport. "You look like Don King with your hair sticking up" is not a sport.
* Other domains trump this domain
* Competitive activities based on mental skill, such as chess or poker, would NOT be considered sports

**Behavior Management:** The following types of speech are in the Behavior Management domain:

* Behavioral directives do not need to explain why the directive is being given
* Questions about behavior are BM if specific, but vague questions like "What do we do?" should be coded as unspecified
* Can be implicit or explicit, with implicit directives usually being dependent on context (see examples below for clarification)
* Prompts/praise for continuation or completion of the directed behavior
* Reasons for why to not to the behavior are in this domain unless trumped by another domain
* If something is both a behavioral directive and another category (besides unspecified), code as the other category
* Only trying to get someone's attention ("hey!") is not behavioral

Note: To distinguish between the *Behavior Management* and *Behaviors* domains, a tip would be to look at the response. If a parent says "Could you put on your shoes?" and the child says "I need help," then it was a behavioral directive, and should be coded in this domain. If the child responds "Not with gloves on!" then the child is interpreting it as a behavior. This is the subtle difference between telling people what to do (behavior management) and saying what is being done (behaviors).

**Behaviors:** The following types of speech are in the Behaviors domain:

* Self-talk/narration of your own or another animate actor's actions, as part of dyadic interaction (can be past, current, or future)
* Can refer to behaviors not completed, but must be behavioral states, not personal attributes
* Talk like "I want to do X" should be in this domain if X can occur in the near future and is possible (describing wishes for the future or impossible desires would be in the preferences domain)
* Phrases with "can" are occasionally in this domain if "I can..." is used to mean "I am currently..."

**Preferences:** The following types of speech are in the Preferences domain:

* Wants, favorites, likes, dislikes, and wishes
* Discussion about what someone would prefer to do next
* Do NOT code wants as emotional unless it has other context that makes it clearly fit into that domain

**Scripts/Recitation:** The following types of speech are in the Scripts/Recitiation (S/R) domain:

* Reading a book out loud (note that discussion of the book is not in this domain)
* Scripts and ritualized interactions
* Ritualized exclamations (not spontaneous interjections/exclamations)

**Rules:** The following types of speech are in the Rules domain:

* Stating rules to a game
* Telling someone to follow the rules is behavior management

**Unspecified:** The following types of speech are in the Unspecified domain:

* Utterances that do not clearly fall into any of the above domains
* Questions about choices
* Possessive declarations (unless trumped by another category)

Note: Occasionally several domains (Behaviors, Preferences, Rules, S/R) will be coded as subtypes of the Unspecified domain. This is not the standard method of current coding, but if you encounter this or are asked to use this system, remember that you should mark only the subtype's column and not the Unspecified column.
