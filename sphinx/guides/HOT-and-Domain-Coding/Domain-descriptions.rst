Domain Descriptions
===================

**Social**:
The following types of speech are in the Social domain:

* Perspective taking
* Interpersonal conflict/competition (including needs)
* Explicitly explaining that ones actions are motivated by feelings towards another
* Relates how we interact with others, society, or culture, not simply comparing two people (actions, looks, etc.)
* May concern facts about family members, kinship systems
* Assertion of identity, but must be more than a simple description of a trait
* Does not include assertion of ownership of objects
* Society-wide social abstractions/norms, such as gender talk or age talk
* Concepts like "nice," "mean," "kind," "good," "evil," etc.
* Ideas of "magic words" in society such as "please" or "thank you", noting that requests for "please" or "thank you" is recitation rather than social
* How we should interact with others in a more general sense than specific directives
* Identification of social roles, noting that this is the weakest possible Social instance
* Celebration of holidays or discussion of holiday traditions
* Social roles and future jobs, noting that if the role fits better into a different domain (e.g. discussing drummers is AMD, discussing what doctors do is NW) that domain should be coded over Social
* People from different countries and their traditions
