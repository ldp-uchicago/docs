Domain Descriptions
===================

**Social**:
The following types of speech are in the Social domain:

* Perspective taking
* Interpersonal conflict/competition (including needs)
* Explicitly explaining that ones actions are motivated by feelings towards another
* Relates how we interact with others, society, or culture, not simply comparing two people (actions, looks, etc.)
* May concern facts about family members, kinship systems
* Assertion of identity, but must be more than a simple description of a trait
* Does not include assertion of ownership of objects
* Society-wide social abstractions/norms, such as gender talk or age talk
* Concepts like "nice," "mean," "kind," "good," "evil," etc.
* Ideas of "magic words" in society such as "please" or "thank you", noting that requests for "please" or "thank you" is recitation rather than social
* How we should interact with others in a more general sense than specific directives
* Identification of social roles, noting that this is the weakest possible Social instance
* Celebration of holidays or discussion of holiday traditions
* Social roles and future jobs, noting that if the role fits better into a different domain (e.g. discussing drummers is AMD, discussing what doctors do is NW) that domain should be coded over Social
* People from different countries and their traditions

**Emotional:**

The following types of speech are in the Emotional domain:

* Discussing feelings (emotion words)
* Expressing love
* Emotional adjectives are only emotional if describing personal feelings, and can exist in utterances that are not in this domain
* Physical states or conditions (e.g. tired, hungry, thirty, ok, etc.) are not emotions
* Descriptors like "funny" or "silly" are not emotions

**Natural World:**

The following types of speech are in the Natural World domain:

* Science, technology, engineering, physical sciences, natural sciences
* Changes in state such as aging, physical states, and changes in color
* Mechanics of how things work such as understanding simple and complex machines, differences between machines or objects, or how electricity works
* Functionality of objects including fixing things, noting that saying something is "broken" is not sufficient without additional information
* Nature including weather, water, animals, outer space, plants, food from the earth, and geography, noting that mentioning these topics is not sufficient without also saying something about them
* Natural waste, trash, pollution, noting that while cleaning things is not sufficient, discussion of how cleaning works is
* Explaining things about the body
* Health, including discussion of healthy food (but not food preferences)
* Cooking and food talk, including discussion of chemical reactions during cooking and identifying real and pretend food
* Artistic representations of natural phenomena, unless the point is to understand the artwork

**Mathematics:**

The following types of speech are in the Mathematics domain:

* Measurements: quantity, size, height, speed, depth, weight, degrees, movement
* Numbers: counting, calculations, how to write numbers, recognizing Arabic numerals
* Estimation
* Specific shapes and shape attributes
* Phrases using words like "big" may not be mathematics
* Having a "math word" in an utterance does not mean it is necessarily math

**Spatial Reasoning:**

The following types of speech are in the Spatial Reasoning domain:

* Spatial relations (using words like "above", "below", "next to", etc.)
* Manipulating objects in the context of other objects; turns, flips, and slides of objects to check for congruency
* Talk of "fitting"
* Where/location questions are not necessarily spatial, but are coded as spatial if answered with explicit localization/spatialization speech
* Movements upon other objects (note that movements on the self are behavioral)
* Use of "here" vs. "there" or "far" vs. "near" are not specific enough without being able to identify the object of reference (gestures can be used to help identify the reference)
* Use of "here" to get attention rather than locate something is not spatial (typically from parents)
* Metaphorical uses of spatial language are not spatial
