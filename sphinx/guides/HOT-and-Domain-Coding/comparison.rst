**Comparison**
==============

*Comparison:* Uses an explicit framework of speech to point out a similarity or difference between two representations: source and analog

Instances of Comparison
=======================
Comparisons are fairly common in our coding. These types of speech should be coded as HOT-Comparison.

* **Metaphor:** Clear instances of metaphor, including simile, are instances of comparison.

  *Must be able to identify a source (sometimes called a base) and a target/analog: Where A is like B, A is target and B is the source.
 
* **Comparatives and Superlatives:** Comparatives grade one thing as more or less of a quality than something esle. Superlatives grade one as being the most or least of a quality of all things like it.

  *comparatives are usually constructed by more/less + adjective or adjective + -er
  
  *children sometimes use comparatives as simple adjectives, for example saying "bigger" when they mean "big"; these are not comparison
  
  *comparatives are usually constructed by more/less + adjective or adjective + -er
  
  *children sometimes use comparatives as simple adjectives, for example saying "bigger" when they mean "big"; these are not comparison
  
  *comparatives can be coded with two clearly indexed objects, or one object/index compared to itself at another time point, so long as the time points are not ambiguous (e.g. "The birdie is closer now!" is a surface comparison, but "The birdie is closer" without clear time reference is NOT)
  
  *superlatives are usually constructed by most/least + adjective or adjective + -est
  
  *people, especially children, often use superlatives without truly comparing anything (e.g. "she's my most favoritest"), these utterances should not be coded unless it is clear that a true comparison is being drawn between two indexes
  
  *saying "my favorite" isn't good enough

Keep in Mind
============

#.  *Listing is Not Always Comparing:* Prompting a list by asking "who else?" or "what else?" is not always asking for a comparison. Asking for examples, or giving examples, is only a comparison if you can articulate what makes those things similar or different.
#.  *Like This:* Saying something goes "like this" can be comparison, but is not always. Code when it is physically like something but not like in demonstration. Use video or gesture column to elucidate.
#.   *Look Closer at Too, Another, etc.:* Do not code words to like too or other state words or additional language without explicit comparison. If too can be replaced with also, that is a good indicator that it is comparative. Words like another can indicate comparison, but only when they are accompanied by language expressing what the compared quality is, not simply that "here is a thing and here is another thing."
#.  *Synonyms:* Sometimes people will use words which mean "act like" or "the same as" such as the word "imitate." It is not important that the child knows the definition of the word but if the word invokes a comparison then code as comparison.
#.  * -er -est words not always HOT:* State changing language is necessary for comparative/superlative words to be coded as HOT. For example, "It is closer." is not HOT. However, "I'm putting it closer." is definitely HOT. State changing language reflects a temporal relationship between the way an object was or will be, and the way it is now. Look for action verbs in past, present progressive (-ing verbs) or future tense. For example, "I ran faster." "I'm running faster." "I will run faster." However, "I run faster." is not HOT as no temporal language is present and there is no second representation. This example may become HOT if there is a subordinating conjunction, such as "than", attached to it. For example, "I run faster than you." Subordinating conjunctions, followed by a subject or object, provide a second representation from which to make a comparison.
#.  *"Too X to..." Comparisons:* Typically "too X to Y" construction is coded as comparison. If you believe that you could reasonably gloss the "to" as "in order to", rather than also coding an inference, code the comparison as structure.
#.  *Looks/Sounds/Seems Like:* When deciding whether a "looks/seems/sounds like" is comparison or just labeling, consider whether the speaker has given any indication that they aren't sure, such as a parent asking "what are you drawing?" and following it up with "it looks like a tree." Even if the child confirms it is a tree, this should be coded as comparison. That can occur in many contexts, such as behavior modification: "What are you guys doing in there? It sounds like you're running." The parent may not really need to ask, and may know exactly what is being drawn, what behavior is occurring, etc., but you should use their language as the deciding factor.

Keywords
=========
These words often (not always) indicate HOT-Comparison:

* like
* also
* similar (to)
* same (as)
* imitate
*  match
* different (from)
* both
* neither
* adj + -er
* adj + -est

Surface vs. Structure
=======================
HOT-Comparison can be either surface or structure.

    Code as surface when...
        comparing physical attributes (color, appearance, size, sound, etc.)
        drawing basic parallels and differences (x "better than" y, "both from Chicago", want eggs "like yesterday", etc.)
    Code as structure when...
        comparing emotional states ("brave like Piglet")
        drawing complex parallels or differences about the nature, structure, or functionality of an object, for example how a toy works rather than how it looks
