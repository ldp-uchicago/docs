Surface vs. Structure
=====================

General Guidelines
==================

Every HOT utterance is coded either as a *structure HOT* or a *surface HOT*.  See specific pages for each type of HOT for further examples of surface vs. structure.  

*  If an utterance is both surface and structure, then structure trumps surface.

*  The depth of description provided will determine if an utterance is surface or structure.

   *``I wonder what we could put in there is *surface*``

   *``It's a round hole and two inches deep, I wonder what we could put in there is *structure*``

*  If you aren't sure what an utterance means, code as surface.

Surface Guidelines
===================

Code as surface when HOT speech:

*  Relates preferences, wants, desires, or needs.

*  Describes relationships with physical sensations such as:

    *Temperature
    *Hunger
    *Pain
    *e.g. When you kick me, that hurts.
    
*  Describes relationships with physical attributes such as:

    *Color
    *Appearance
    *Weight
    *Sound
    *Strength
    *e.g. Daddy is stronger than Mommy.
