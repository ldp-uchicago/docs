Surface vs. Structure Tips
==========================

Every HOT utterance should be coded as either surface or structure.

See the sections for each type of HOT for additional tips specific to that type.

General Guidelines
==================

    If an utterance is both surface and structure, you will only mark one, and structure will trump surface.
    How options are being described demonstrates underlying structure of construct.
        I wonder what we could put in there is surface
        Itâ€™s a round hole and two inches deep, I wonder what we could put in thereis structure
    If you aren't sure what an utterance means, code as surface, especially when calling speech HOT means giving the child the benefit of the doubt.

Surface Guidelines
===================

Code as surface when HOT speech:

    Relates preferences, wants, desires, or needs.
    Describes relationships with physical sensations such as:
        Temperature
        Hunger
        Pain
        e.g. When you kick me, that hurts.
    Describes relationships with physical attributes such as:
        Color
        Appearance
        Weight
        Sound
        Strength
        e.g. Daddy is stronger than Mommy.
