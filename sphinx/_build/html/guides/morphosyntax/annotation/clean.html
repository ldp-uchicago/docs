<span id="mg-clean"></span><h1>Prepping a transcript<a class="headerlink" href="#prepping-a-transcript" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Prior to adding any part-of-speech annotation, you will need to clean up a few
things in the transcript to make it conform to the CHAT transcription standards.
This is necessary for the morphosyntax programs to properly parse and tag the
transcripts.  The following steps explain how to prep your transcript prior to
running the MOR and POST commands.</p>
<div class="section" id="remove-disfluencies-and-repetitions">
<span id="mg-clean-1"></span><h2>1. Remove disfluencies and repetitions<a class="headerlink" href="#remove-disfluencies-and-repetitions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Speakers will often repeat or stumble over a word or phrase.  When this happens,
remove the repeated or unintended words, leaving only the necessary and/or
intentional parts of the utterance.  To find repetitions and disfluencies, search
for the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#</span></tt> symbol, which denotes a pause or a re-casting of an utterance.</p>
<p>The general rules to follow are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p class="first">Use only the words that were spoken.</p>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>From those words, leave only those that the speaker intended to say.</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>When determining whether something was intended or not, give preference to what was spoken last.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><p class="first">From those words, give the speaker as much credit as possible for complex constructions while making the most grammatically coherent sentence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For instance, if you search for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#</span></tt> and see:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>*CHI:   I # I # I want the ball .
*MOT:   give him the bowl # ball .</pre>
</div>
<p>remove the repetitions of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">I</span></tt> and the accidental use of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bowl</span></tt> to make it:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>*CHI:   I want the ball .
*MOT:   give him the ball .</pre>
</div>
<p>In general, you will want to preserve what is said to the right of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#</span></tt>, as this is probably what the speaker intended to say.  For instance:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>*MOT:   he brought # he took it .</pre>
</div>
<p>would be cleaned up as:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>*MOT:   he took it .</pre>
</div>
<p>However, you also want to give them as much credit for complex constructions as possible given the words that they spoke.  This means that if a speaker said:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>*CHI:   this fire+truck has # it drives real fast .</pre>
</div>
<p>you would want to give them credit for the more complex noun phrase structure and would thus retain <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">this</span> <span class="pre">fire+truck</span></tt>, while removing the accidental use of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">has</span></tt> and the grammatically redundant and less complex use of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">it</span></tt>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>*CHI:   this fire+truck drives real fast .</pre>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">You will not always need to remove words for every instance of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#</span></tt>.  Sometimes this simply denotes a pause in the speech, and not a repetition or re-casting of the utterance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="remove-utterances-consisting-only-of">
<span id="mg-clean-1-1"></span><h3>1.1. Remove utterances consisting only of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#</span></tt><a class="headerlink" href="#remove-utterances-consisting-only-of" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Occasionally you will come across an utterance that has no words in it, only the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#</span></tt> symbol.  When you do, delete that speech tier, as well as its
corresponding %row and %id tiers.  For instance, in the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>*MOT:   sure .
%id:    10850900151
%row:   151
*MOT:   #
%id:    10850900152
%row:   152
*CHI:   seven, eight, nine, eleven, twelve +...
%id:    10850900153
%row:   153</pre>
</div>
<p>Row 152 should be removed, resulting in the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>*MOT:   sure .
%id:    10850900151
%row:   151
*CHI:   seven, eight, nine, eleven, twelve +...
%id:    10850900153
%row:   153</pre>

<span id="mg-clean-2"></span><h2>2. Find and remove repeated words and phrases<a class="headerlink" href="#find-and-remove-repeated-words-and-phrases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Not all repeated words and phrases are transcribed with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#</span></tt> symbol.  This
is especially true when the words are spoken rapidly and/or intentionally.
However, we still want to reduce repeated words and phrases to only the necessary
elements.  Therefore, even when a speaker intends to repeat a word (for emphasis
or during word play, for example), remove all but one instance of it.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">A repetition should not be removed if it is grammatically correct.  For instance, &#8220;I know that that isn&#8217;t right&#8221; and &#8220;if you throw it it will break&#8221; are grammatically correct and the repetitions of &#8220;that&#8221; and &#8220;it&#8221; are therefore not removed.</p>
</div>
<p>There are two ways to find repetitions:</p>
<div class="section" id="use-the-tn-shortcut-in-vi-to-find-single-word-repetitions">
<span id="mg-clean-2-1"></span><h3>2.1. Use the <em>tn</em> shortcut in VI to find single-word repetitions<a class="headerlink" href="#use-the-tn-shortcut-in-vi-to-find-single-word-repetitions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you have downloaded and set up your <a class="reference internal" href="setup.html#mg-setup-4"><em>.vimrc file</em></a>, you can
simply press the key combination <em>tn</em> when viewing the file with the VI editor.
This will execute a search for any single word that is repeated.  When you are
finished removing the repetitions in one utterance, you can find the next by
pressing <em>n</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-the-program-dis-to-find-repeated-words-and-phrases">
<span id="mg-clean-2-2"></span><h3>2.2. Use the program <strong>dis</strong> to find repeated words and phrases<a class="headerlink" href="#use-the-program-dis-to-find-repeated-words-and-phrases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To find repeated words and phrases using <strong>dis</strong>, open a second terminal window
and navigate to the directory containing the file you are working on (for example,
<em>$REPO/chat/proj_2/coders/max</em>).  Then, run the program <strong>dis</strong> by typing:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>dis 123.09.cha</pre>
</div>
<p>This will print a list of row numbers on which repeated words or phrases are
found.  For instance, the following shows that there is a repetition on rows 57
and 276.:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>dis 123.09.cha

%row:   57
%row:   276</pre>
</div>
<p>You can use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-p</span></tt> switch to print the entire utterance as well, or the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-v</span></tt> switch to print the repeated words or phrases.:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>dis -p 123.09.cha

*CHI:   this is for for Daddy .
%row:   57
*MOT:   you have to, have to eat some more vegetables .
%row:   276


dis -v 123.09.cha

Repetition: for
%row:   57
Repetition: have to
%row:   276</pre>
</div>
<p>You will then have to find these rows in the file you are working on and remove
all but one instance of the repeated word or phrase.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="add-an-symbol-to-the-beginning-of-non-words">
<span id="mg-clean-3"></span><h2>3. Add an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&amp;</span></tt> symbol to the beginning of non-words<a class="headerlink" href="#add-an-symbol-to-the-beginning-of-non-words" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

symbol to the beginning (i.e. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&amp;oh</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&amp;uh</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&amp;um</span></tt>, etc.).  Also affix <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&amp;</span></tt>
to the beginning of every instance of &#8220;xxx&#8221;, the symbol for unintelligible
speech.  We do this so that these words are not counted as word types and tokens
and do not contribute to a speaker&#8217;s Mean Length of Utterance (MLU).</p>
<p>If you are using the VI text editor and have <a class="reference internal" href="setup.html#mg-setup-4"><em>set up the .vimrc file</em></a>,
simply type the key combination <em>`c</em> (that is the symbol on the same key as the
~ symbol) to invoke a search and replace command that will execute this process for you.</p>

<p>Due to formatting and/or transcriber error, you may sometimes come across family
relationship terms that do not have the proper capitalization.  As specified in
<a class="reference internal" href="../../transcription/sect_6.html#tg-6-2-2"><em>section 6.2.2</em></a> of the Transcription Guide, &#8220;Mom&#8221;, &#8220;Dad&#8221;,
&#8220;Grandma&#8221;, and other such terms should be capitalized when used as a proper noun
(e.g. &#8220;hey Mom, can you open this?&#8221;) and lower-case when used as a common noun
(e.g. &#8220;my dad is stronger than your dad.&#8221;).  There are two VI shortcuts to help
you find potential problem cases.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, some words are written as two words that should either be one word or should be joined with an apostrophe.  Make the following changes if the shortcut finds these phrases:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>all right       =&gt;      alright (when used in the same sense as "okay")
is got          =&gt;      has got (this was due to an older script we use to run that expanded
                                   's, but sometimes expanded it to the wrong thing)
let us          =&gt;      let's</pre>

<span id="mg-clean-5-3"></span><h3>5.3. Two capitalized words in a row<a class="headerlink" href="#two-capitalized-words-in-a-row" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you find two capitalized words in a row, determine whether they are meant to be part of a single proper noun.  For instance, if you found &#8220;let&#8217;s talk to Aunt Judy&#8221;, you would want to combine &#8220;Aunt&#8221; and &#8220;Judy&#8221; following the rules in <a class="reference internal" href="../../transcription/sect_6.html#tg-6-5"><em>Section 6.5</em></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../../transcription/sect_6.html#tg-6-6"><em>6.6</em></a> of the transcription guide (i.e. &#8220;let&#8217;s talk to Aunt+Judy&#8221;).</p>
<p>This part of the shortcut tends to match things that often don&#8217;t need to be fixed, for example &#8220;Mom, I want a donut&#8221; or &#8220;did you talk to Judy, David?&#8221;.  Leave these words separated and capitalized.</p>

<p>Sometimes, especially in earlier transcripts, you will find a sentence-final punctuation mark (. ! ?) in the middle of an utterance.  This is incorrect according to <a class="reference internal" href="../../transcription/sect_3.html#tg-3-1"><em>rule 3.1</em></a> of the transcription guide and will confuse the syntax software.  Remove these punctuation marks, replacing with a comma if appropriate.  You may also have to lower-case the word following the punctuation if it is not a proper noun.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>come here.  Let me put on your coat .   =&gt;      come here, let me put on your coat .
be quiet!  Mommy is talking .           =&gt;      be quiet, Mommy is talking .
where are you going?  asked the bear .  =&gt;      where are you going, asked the bear .</pre>

<span id="mg-clean-5-5"></span><h3>5.5. Repetitions marked by <em>[xN]</em><a class="headerlink" href="#repetitions-marked-by-xn" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Words and phrases that are repeated three or fewer times are simply transcribed with a dash or pound sign between repetitions (e.g. &#8220;let&#8217;s # let&#8217;s # let&#8217;s play this&#8221;).  Four or more repetitions are transcribed using the notation <em>[xN]</em> where N is the number of times the word or phrase is repeated.  If you find this construction, remove the brackets and everything inside (since we don&#8217;t care about repeated words anyway).</p>
<p>Repeated phrases are written in angle brackets (<em>&lt;&gt;</em>).  If you find a repeated phrase, remove the angle brackets from around the phrase.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>no[x7], I don't want to !               =&gt;      no, I don't want to !
&lt;I'm going to&gt;[x5] play with my train . =&gt;      I'm going to play with my train .</pre>

<p>While we never use quotation marks in our transcripts now, you will sometimes see them in older transcripts.  Double quotes (&#8221;) are usually removed automatically, but it&#8217;s harder to remove single quotes (&#8216;), since these are also used in contractions.  The shortcut will search for a single quote that does not follow a letter character, and is thus probably being used as a quotation mark, not an apostrophe.  You may also have to remove punctuation associated with the quoted part of the utterance.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>'help!' he cried .              =&gt;      help, he cried .
Mom said 'oh no you don't' .    =&gt;      Mom said, oh no you don't .</pre>

<span id="mg-clean-5-7"></span><h3>5.7. Apostrophes in proper nouns<a class="headerlink" href="#apostrophes-in-proper-nouns" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Similarly, apostrophes are never supposed to appear in proper nouns, even those that would have one in standard written English (e.g. Reese&#8217;s Pieces should be Reeses+Pieces).  If the shortcut finds an apostrophe in a proper noun, simply remove it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="misuse-of-the-l-marker">
<span id="mg-clean-5-8"></span><h3>5.8. Misuse of the <em>&#64;l</em> marker<a class="headerlink" href="#misuse-of-the-l-marker" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When converting transcripts from our transcription format to the CHAT transcription format, the pronoun &#8220;I&#8221; and the indefinite article &#8220;a&#8221; sometimes get tagged as the letter &#8220;i&#8221; and the letter &#8220;a&#8221;.  If the shortcut finds any instances of <em>i&#64;l</em> or <em>a&#64;l</em>, determine whether they are in fact letters.  If they are not, remove the <em>&#64;l</em> tag and capitalize <em>i</em>.</p>
<p>Also during the converting process, some newer transcripts mistakenly have two <em>&#64;l</em> tags.  If you find an instance of this, simply remove one of the tags.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>a@l is a letter.  Leave it alone:
        a@l is for apple .      =&gt;      a@l is for apple .

a@l is an article.  Change it:
        do you have a@l b@l ?   =&gt;      do you have a b@l ?

i@l is a letter.  Leave it alone:
        give me an i@l !        =&gt;      give me an i@l !

i@l is a pronoun.  Change it:
        no, i@l am not .        =&gt;      no, I am not .

Too many @l tags.  Remove one:
        a@l@l is for apple .    =&gt;      a@l is for apple .</pre>

<p>Sometimes a speech tier will be missing an utterance-final marker (either
typical punctuation marks or the symbol <em>+...</em>).  If you find such an utterance,
add the appropriate mark at the end, remembering to separate it from the last
word with a space.</p>

<div class="section" id="run-caps-to-verify-that-capitalized-words-are-proper-nouns-and-are-correctly-formatted">
<span id="mg-clean-6"></span><h2>6. Run <strong>caps</strong> to verify that capitalized words are proper nouns and are correctly formatted<a class="headerlink" href="#run-caps-to-verify-that-capitalized-words-are-proper-nouns-and-are-correctly-formatted" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For whatever reason, transcripts sometimes contain capitalized words that are actually common nouns.  They may also contain proper nouns that are sometimes capitalized and sometimes lower-case.  To ensure that all capitalized words are actually proper nouns and that there are not lower-case instances of proper nouns, run the program <strong>caps</strong>.  This will print out a list of all capitalized words, as well as an indicator if one of those words also has lower-case instances.:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Alice_In_Wonderland
Connect_Four
Dad             --&gt;     check lower case
Dora
Grant           --&gt;     check lower case
Ick
Lady            --&gt;     check lower case
Laura
Mom
Twentythree</pre>
</div>
<p>If you see something in the list that looks like it should not be a proper noun, go back into the transcript and fix it.  For example, &#8220;Twentythree&#8221; and &#8220;Ick&#8221; are not proper nouns and need to be lower-cased and possibly reformatted, i.e. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">twenty+three</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ick</span></tt>.</p>
<p>If you see something in the list that has a &#8220;check lower case&#8221; indicator, go back into the transcript and make sure that the lower-case instances are correct.  If not, capitalize those instances.  For example, &#8220;Grant&#8221; and &#8220;Lady&#8221; (from &#8220;Lady and the Tramp&#8221;) are proper names.  However, when we convert from our transcription format to the CHAT transcription format, sentence-initial words that are recognized by the CLAN lexicon are lower-cased, in this case erroneously, so you could capitalize those words.</p>
<p>Not all lower-case instances need to be capitalized, however.  For example, &#8220;Dad&#8221; can have a proper noun usage and a common noun usage.  When used in place of a name (&#8220;did you see Dad in the garage?&#8221;), &#8220;Dad&#8221; should be capitalized.  When used as a common noun (&#8220;my dad is taller than your dad&#8221;), it should remain lower-case.  Thus you can have upper- and lower-case instances of some words in the same transcript.</p>
<p>After you go through the list and make the necessary changes to the transcript, run <strong>caps</strong> again until the list contains only correctly formatted proper nouns, and all the lower-case indicators have been confirmed.  For example, after making all of the necessary changes, the list would now look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Alice_In_Wonderland
Connect_Four
Dad             --&gt;     check lower case
Dora
Grant
Lady
Laura
Mom</pre>
</div>
<p>The program <strong>caps</strong> will also print a list of words that have an ampersand in front of them (except for &#8220;oh&#8221;, &#8220;uh&#8221;, &#8220;um&#8221;, &#8220;ooh&#8221;, &#8220;ah&#8221;, and &#8220;xxx&#8221; which always have an ampersand).  This list also includes a comment if there is an un-ampersanded instance of an ampersanded word:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Ampersanded words:

&amp;bitiba         --&gt;     check for unampersanded instances
&amp;chickeny
&amp;phwoosh</pre>
</div>
<p>If you see something in the list that looks like it should be counted as a real word, go back into the transcript and remove the ampersand.  For instance, although &#8220;chickeny&#8221; is not a dictionary word, it is formed with the -y suffix of <a class="reference internal" href="../../transcription/sect_6.html#tg-6-11"><em>rule 6.11</em></a>.  Since we want to count it as a word, remove the ampersand from all instances of &#8220;chickeny&#8221; in the transcript.</p>
<p>The utterances &#8220;phwoosh&#8221; and &#8220;bitiba&#8221;, on the other hand, do not qualify as words, and so should retain the ampersand.  However, &#8220;bitiba&#8221; has unampersanded instances in the transcript that must be ampersanded.</p>
<p>After making the changes to these ampersanded words, run <strong>caps</strong> again and verify that these words are correctly transcribed.  Repeat this process until you are satisfied that everything is properly formatted.  For example, after making all of the necessary changes, the list would now look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Ampersanded words:

&amp;bitiba
&amp;phwoosh</pre>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
