<h2>Instructions for Spring Writing Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#instructions-for-spring-writing-tests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>THE SINGLE WORD WRITING EXPERIMENT IS ON THE COGSKETCH LAPTOP DESKTOP. GO TO <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ece</span> <span class="pre">CogSketch</span> <span class="pre">Experiment</span></tt> FOLDER, THEN CLICK ON <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ece-2011-words.sk</span></tt> FILE. ENTER THE CHILD’S SUBJECT NUMBERS, GRADE, AND YEAR, E.G. 35_4G_3_12.</p>
<p>SINCE THE CHILD WILL BE LISTENING TO WORDS, MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE IN A RELATIVELY QUIET PART OF THE HOUSE PREFERABLY A ROOM WITH A DESK AVAILABLE. TO BEGIN, GIVE THE CHILD THE TABLET COMPUTER AND THE STYLUS. FAMILIARIZE THE CHILD WITH THE SETUP. ROTATE THE SCREEN SO THAT THE SCROLL BAR IS NOT UNDER THE CHILD’S ARM</p>
<p>This is a special computer. It’s special because you can write on it just like you can write on a piece of paper. You can write on it with this special pen. Here is the computer and the pen. We are going to start by writing your name, some numbers and words on this computer.</p>
<p>GO THE FIRST PAGE OF COGSKETCH LABELLED AS “NAME” AND LET THE CHILD WRITE THEIR FIRST AND LAST NAME. ALSO SHOW THEM HOW TO SCROLL DOWN IF NECESSARY.</p>
<p>You can write on the computer like you normally would.  Let’s start by spelling your name. If you make a mistake, just cross out what you wrote and then continue writing. If you run out of space, scroll down using your pen and continue writing your name. Let me know when you are done.</p>
<p>Good job!</p>
<p>CONTINUE BY ASKING THE CHILD TO WRITE NUMBERS. PRESS THE NEXT BUTTON TO MOVE TO THE NEXT PAGE LABELLED AS “NUMBERS”</p>
<p>I would now like for you to write the numbers that I tell you. Again, if you run out of space, scroll down using your pen and continue to write. If you make a mistake, just cross out what you wrote and continue to write.</p>
<p>SAY THE NUMBERS IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER ONE BY ONE. WAIT FOR THE CHILD TO FINISH AND THEN SAY THE NEXT NUMBER:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>31  24  7   33  15  2   19  38  6   18  23</pre>
</div>
<p>Good job!</p>
<p>WHEN THE CHILD IS DONE AND BEFORE PRESSING THE NEXT BUTTON, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW. ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THE SOUND OF THE COMPUTER IS AS LOUD AS POSSIBLE BUT WITHOUT DISTORTION. YOU CAN ALSO USE HEADPHONES FOR THE CHILD AFTER YOU READ THE INSTRUCTIONS.</p>
<p>In this next part, I will ask you to spell some words. When you press the next button POINT TO THE NEXT BUTTON, the computer will play a word. After the computer plays a word, I would like for you to spell it out. Make sure that you spell the word as quickly and as accurately as you can after you hear it, okay? When you are done spelling the word, press the next button again to hear the next word and spell that one down.  You will hear a bunch of words like this.</p>
<p>There are certain things I would like you to pay attention to. Make sure that you press the next button and not the red cross. The computer will play each word only once. So please pay very close attention. OK? If you cannot hear the word well, or if you think there are multiple ways to spell it, just use your best guess. Try to make your word fit on this page. If you make a mistake, just cross out what you wrote and continue writing. Finally, please do not write in cursive. Do you have any questions for me? Once we start, I will not be able to answer any questions until we are done with this part of the study.</p>
<p>LOOK FOR CONFIRMATION THAT THE CHILD UNDERSTANDS</p>
<p>Are you ready? After you press this button, you will hear the first word. Please get ready to write with your pen, and write it as quickly and as accurately as you can when you hear it.</p>
<p>THE CHILD CAN PRESS THE BUTTON AT THEIR OWN PACE. THERE WILL BE A 1 SEC DELAY BEFORE YOU HEAR THE WORD. IF THEY DO NOT CONTINUE OR HESITATE</p>
<p>Good job! Press the next button to hear the next word and write it down.</p>
<p>WHEN THE CHILD IS ALL DONE</p>
<p>We are done with this part. Good job!</p>
