# LDP Visit Periods

The language development project has observed a set of subjects (falling into two groups) over three distinct periods:

* 14 to 58 months (observations occurred at 4 month intervals)

* KG to 4G (observations made 3 times each year)

* 5G to 9G

Each period is unique in its observational protocol.


#### Period 1: Preschool visits

*12 visit sessions from 14 to 58 months*

The observations made within this period were originally known as the "home visits".  The first observations were made when subjects were 14 months of age and continued at four month intervals up to 58 months of age, for a total of 12 visit sessions.

| VISIT | MONTH |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1     | 14    |
| 2     | 18    |
| 3     | 22    |
| 4     | 26    |
| 5     | 30    |
| 6     | 34    |
| 7     | 38    |
| 8     | 42    |
| 9     | 46    |
| 10    | 50    |
| 11    | 54    |
| 12    | 58    |


#### Period 2: Elementary school visits

*? visit sessions from grades KG to 4G*

The observations made within this period were originally known as the "literacy visits".  The first observations were made when subjects were entering kindergarten and continued through fourth grade.

Observations were taken three times each year:

* fall (sep-oct)
* winter (jan-feb)
* spring (may-jun)

The visits were done in the families' homes, and included measures given to the children to assess reading, math and spatial skills.  Experimenter-elicited talk was also collected from the child during narrative tasks as was spontaneous conversation between experimenter and child.  


#### Period 3: Middle school visits

*? visit sessions from grades 5 to 9*

The observations for this period are currently being collected.  We will observe subjects from grades five to nine.  The observations will consist of parent-child interaction over activities designed to elicit higher order thinking as well as experimenter-child interactions over similar activities.  In addition, standardized and homegrown measures were given to children and parents to measure skills relevant to higher order thinking.
